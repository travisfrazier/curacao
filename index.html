      <h2>Tugboat Beach</h2>
      <p>Tugboat is one of Curaçao’s most famous and popular dive sites. Named after the tugboat 
        that was accidentally sunk years ago, this little wreck rests at just 5 m (17ft). 
        Snorkelers will see that that there’s a lot more to the site, however, including a dramatic, pretty wall on one side, 
        and a shallow reef to the other, home to a large variety of reef fish and cool creatures. The reef drops off much deeper for the 
        more adventurous divers.</p>
